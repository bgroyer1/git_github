# 73-78: From Local To Remote

## 73: Personal Access Tokens

- In github, go to settings while in the repository you want to create a token for
- Scroll to developer settings
- Click on create token
- You can define the expiration date of a token to limit how long someone has access for
- You then can define **what the person with a token is able to do in the repo**
- Make sure to copy the tokens as soon as you create them! They won't be able to be accessed again

## 74: Mac User Notes

In the next lecture we will update the Personal Access Token (3:40 in the next video).

For MacOS users, the credentials can be updated via the terminal as follows:

---

```git
git credential-osxkeychain erase //PRESS RETURN KEY

host=github.com //PRESS RETURN KEY

protocol=https //PRESS RETURN KEY

// press return key
```

## 75: Pushing A Second Commit

- We created a second file, and pushed it to github.
- I used git push and it worked without adding origin main, but in the video it failed for him and said that the project didn't have an upstream. Maybe he didn't include the -u when he linked to the remote repo?
- If upstream fails, writing this will work:

```git
    git push origin main
```

- We navigated to the file folder in github, and clicked on history. This showed us a list of our commits, as well as the unique commit ids
- The credential notes above are used to **delete access tokens**
- Running the second command showed our remote branches in our local repo, while the first command showed all branches, remote and local:

```git
    git branch -a
    git branch -r
```

## 76: Understand The Workflow

- When we created a remote branch, behind the scenes git actually creates a **remote tracking branch**
- This is the branch you see by running git branch -a
- It is a local copy of the remote branch, and tracks changes to your local repo
- There is no direct connection between a local and remote repo, the remote tracking branch will always exist
- If we pull information, we tell github to first update the remote tracking branch
- Git pull is a combo command of this 2 part process:
  - Git Fetch: pulls repo from github to the remote tracking branch
  - Git Merge: Merges changes from the remote tracking branch to local repo

---

## 77: Remote Tracking Branches In Practice

- We created a feature branch in our practice project, and pushed it to github

```git
    git push origin feature
```

- this created a new remote tracking branch in our local repository
- Navigating to github, we also find our remote repo has changed. We can select the feature branch on the branch dropdown menu
- We then created a new branch directly on github, and added a file to it

```git
    git ls-remote
```

- This listed ALL remote branches, including the branch we just created
- Running git fetch pulled the remote feature branch into our remote tracking branch, but i don't see the file in our project yet
- Git fetch will pull all changes to the remote tracking branch
- Git pull requires the specification of where you want to merge with, as it is a combo command
- We entered git checkout <remotes/origin/remote-feature> and entered a detached head state that contained the files we created on git hub
- We could create a new branch in this detached head state and then merge it, but there's a better way...

## 78: Local Tracking Branches

- Remote tracking branch is a local copy of remote branch, which is not edited
- Local tracking branch is a local reference to remote tracking branch **to be edited**
- Git push/pull/fetch are all available in this branch
- How local and remote tracking branches connected:
  - Remote tracking branch can be updated using git fetch 
  - It is a local cache of remote branch's content
  - Changes to the remote tracking branch are then merged to the local tracking branch
  - This allows you to omit the repository name and branch name
  - We can then use git push alone to pull changes from the remote tracking branch to the local tracking branch
