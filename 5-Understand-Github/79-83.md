# From Local To Remote: Understanding Github

## 79: Creating Local Tracking Branches

- We create a local tracking branch with this command:

```git
    git branch --track <name> origin/feature-remote
```

- This is used when you **already have a remote branch and want to manually link a new local branch to it**
- With this, the local tracking branch has been created, and we can push and pull information to github without specifying origin main in our terminal
- His example ran into an error: Upstream branch had a different name than the remote tracking branch. They have to have the same name

```git
    git branch -vv
```

- this shows more details about branches, including if a branch is a tracking branch

## 80: Command Overview

### Show Remote Server

```git
    git remote
```

- shows your current remote server

### List all local and tracking branches

```git
    git branch -a 
```

- lists all local branches, remote tracking branches, and local tracking branches

### List all remote branches

```git
    git branch -r
```

- show remote tracking branches

### Detailed configuration

```git
    git remote show origin
```

- show detailed configuraition

### List local tracking branches and their remote links

```git
    git branch -vv
```

- list local tracking branches and their remotes

### Track a branch created in a remote repository locally

```git
    git branch --track branchname origin/branchname
```

### Prune unneeded remote tracking branches

```git
    git fetch --prune
```

### Manually Delete Local Remote-Tracking Branches


```git
    git branch -d -r origin/<branch_name>
```

### Delete a branch from github

```git
    git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```

### Things to note with git branch -r

- origin/main → The actual remote-tracking branch for main.
- origin/HEAD -> origin/main → A pointer to the default branch on origin, usually main.

### Switch which branch origin/head points to

```git
    git remote set-head origin <branch_name>
```

## 81: Cloning A Remote Repository

- Click on code button
- Select clone , grab the url

```git 
    git clone <url>
```
