# Understanding Github: 67-72

## 67: What Is Github?

### What Is GitHub?

GitHub is the largest development platform in the world, widely used by developers and organizations for version control and collaboration. Here's a deeper look at what GitHub offers:

---

#### 1. **Largest Development Platform**
- GitHub is home to millions of open-source and private repositories, making it the largest platform where developers contribute code. 
- It hosts projects across all programming languages, enabling both individual developers and large organizations to collaborate seamlessly.

#### 2. **Hosting Repositories**
- GitHub allows users to host their code repositories, making it easy to store and manage code. 
- These repositories can be either public or private, giving developers the flexibility to choose the level of visibility they want for their projects. 
- GitHub supports both Git (a version control system) and provides tools to manage branches, pull requests, and commits efficiently.

#### 3. **Cloud Hosting**
- GitHub offers cloud hosting for repositories, meaning your code is stored on GitHub’s servers and accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. 
- This cloud-based approach eliminates the need for local server management and ensures your code is always available and backed up.

#### 4. **Simplified Long-Distance Collaboration**
- GitHub significantly simplifies collaboration, especially when developers are working from different locations. 
- Its features like issues, pull requests, code reviews, and continuous integration (CI) enable teams to collaborate effectively. 
- It also supports GitHub Actions, which automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code, helping streamline the development process for distributed teams.

## 68: From Local To Remote - Theory

### 1. **Git Holds the Local Repository on Your Machine**
- Git is a distributed version control system that stores your project’s history and code changes locally on your machine. 
- Each developer has their own complete version of the repository, including all branches, commits, and history, making it easy to work offline and sync with others when needed.

### 2. **GitHub Holds the Remote Repository**
- GitHub, on the other hand, is where you store the *remote repository*. 
- It acts as a centralized location for your code, enabling collaboration and sharing with other developers. 
- The remote repository is where the changes from all developers are pushed and pulled to keep the project synchronized.

### 3. **Pushing Local Repository to GitHub**
- To push your local changes to a GitHub repository, you first need to link your local repository to the remote one. This is done with the following command:

```git
git remote add origin <url>
```
- Origin is the name given to the remote repository. It's a shorthand for the URL of the GitHub repository you are connecting to.
- You can use a different name instead of origin, but origin has become an industry standard and is most commonly used.
- <url> represents the URL of the remote repository (it could be HTTPS or SSH, depending on how you set up GitHub).

### 4. Pushing Changes to GitHub

- Once the remote repository is linked, you can upload (or "push") your local changes to the GitHub repository with the following command:

```git
    git push origin main
```
- origin refers to the remote repository you are pushing to (the GitHub repository in this case).
- main refers to the branch you are pushing to. Most repositories use main as the default branch, but if you're using a different branch, replace main with the appropriate branch name.
- A push is the process of moving data from your local repository to the remote repository. T

## 5. Pulling Data from GitHub

- The process of retrieving data from a remote repository to your local machine is referred to as a pull. This is done using the command:

```git
    git pull origin main
```

- Here, origin refers to the remote repository, and main is the branch you want to pull from.
- Pulling ensures that your local copy of the project is updated with any changes made by others on the remote repository.

# 73: Creating A Remote Repository

- Github will ask you if you would like to import a repository. This is not a reference to importing a git project, but instead asking if you would like to import a repository from **another** cloud-hosting site
- When working on personal projects, its a strong convention to give your remote and local repositories the same name
- Note that you can define who can commit to a public repository, even though the code is public
- Private repositories are only available to people you share the link with
- Git recommends initializing a remote repo with a readme, .gitignore, and license

# 74: Connecting Local And Remote Repositories

- Adding an existing repository with the command line:

```git
    git remote add origin https://github.com/bgroyer1/github-basics.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
```

- git remote - connect to a remote repository
- add - add a repository
- origin - this is where we designate what we will refer to the following url as; a shorthand
- <url> - the link to the remote repository
- git branch -M main - renames the master branch to main branch
- git push - push changes from local to remote
- -u - upstream, will touch on later in the course
- origin main - reference the url we are pushing to, and tell it which branch we are pushing
