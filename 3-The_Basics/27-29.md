# How Git Works

## Saving commits

- Git does **not** re add and re-store files over and over again. All it does it compare the files in the staging areas changes to previous versions of the files, and **store the changes**

## Working Directory vs Repository

- Say we have a project folder, and we decide to track its changes using git
- A .git folder, which is hidden, is created in the working directory
- This folder is the **git repository**
- The working directory is the area with the project files
- The repository is where the git magic happens, and has two areas:
  - Staging Area, or index file
  - Commits, or objects folder
- Changes are first pushed from the working directory to the staging area
- Changes are then committed in the next area, where the changes are tracked and snapshotted 

## Understanding Branches

- Working directory may also be called a working tree
- The main branch holds **all** previous commits to a project
- Splitting off from the master branch to develop new features is common practice to avoid breaking your project when you encounter inevitable bugs
- Branches create **separate working directories** that are a copy of the current working directory of the main branch
