# Git & GitHub Course Offered Through Udemy

This is the markdown notes and finished assignments for the Git & GitHub course created by Academind, offered on udemy. 

### Highlights

- Well Structured, good pace, informative
- Not overly long! Felt manageable and helped me stay motivated
- Clear instruction! I liked the teachers enough to purchase a couple more courses from them

### Recommendations

- I'd take the course if you're a complete beginner in both git and github. If you're comfortable with git, the courses github section will probably still have something new to offer you

I'm going to keep this repo up, update my notes, and use it as a resource for whenever I forget one of the (million) git commands
