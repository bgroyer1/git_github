## 59: Git Rebase

- Rebasing will take all the commits from the feature branch and add them onto the latest commit of the master branch
- It's still dealing with situations where the master branch has additional commits after the feature branches creation
- First we rebase master to the feature branch. m-3 becomes the new base commit in the feature branch
- then we merge this rebased feature branch into the master branch
- The latest commit in the master branch becomes the "base" commit for the commits in the feature branch
- It's a highly risky strategy! it does not **move commits, it creates new commits**
- **NEVER REBASE COMMITS OUTSIDE YOUR OWN REPOSITORY**
- The f1 and f2 commits in our examples will have **different commit id's after being rebased** than they did when a part of the feature branch
- If your feature relies on new commits in the master branch, rebasing is an option
- Rebasing is also an option if your feature is finished and ready to be implemented into the master branch without merge commits
- Remember rebasing re-writes code history though! Don't see a world where i am going to use it!

## 60: Handling Merge Conflicts

- Accept change in current branch: Changes in main
- Accept changes in incoming branch: Changes in feature
- Accept changes in both: Adds both changes in full
- Compare changes: highlights differences between the two things you are attempting to merge
- Merge editor lets you write your own code to implement bits of both solutions

```git
    git merge --abort
```

- Aborts the merge attempt
- Pretty intuitive system!
- Still have to stage and commit the merge after resolving the merge conflicts

## 62: Merge Vs. Rebase Vs. Cherry-Picking

### Merge

- Non-fast forward merge
- Creates a merge commit combining changes in master and feature

### Rebase

- Changes a single commit's parent
- A new master commit becomes a previous commit before feature branch changes, with new commit id's being created for additional commits in a feature branch

### Cherry Pick

- Add a specific commit to a specific branch 
- Turn this commit into the head
- Creates copies of a commit with a new ID

## 63: Understanding Cherry Picking

- This was cool!
- We switched to our practice branch. I created a new typo in that branch
- Then i switched to the feature branch. I fixed the typo, added it, and committed it to the feature branch
- After that, i created a new folder, added and committed that as well
- Then checked the git log, and grabbed the id of the commit that fixed the typo
- Then i switched back to the practice branch, and used git cherry-pick <commit-id>
- This added the commit from the feature branch to the main branch and fixed the typo, **without** bringing the additional commits to the feature branch i made after
- Note that this new typo fix has **a different commit id in the main branch than it did in the feature branch**

## 64: Working With Tags('git tag')

- Tags are made to find specific commits in your history
- A lightweight tag is used to simply point at a specific commit in the branch
- An annotated tag is a full object with information, such as the person who created the tags email, etc.

```git
    git tag 1.0 <commit_id>
```

- adding a lightweight tag
- Also referred to as a temporary tag

```git
    git show 1.0
```

- Shows the user the tag commit

```git
    git checkout 1.0
```

- Puts the user in detached head mode based on the commit in the tag

```git
    git tag -d 1.0
```

- Deletes the temporary tag

```git
    git tag -a 2.0 'This is the latest version'
```

- Creates an annotated tag with the -a flag
- note the commit message as well!
- Will show the tagger and the date, the message, and the commit id

```git
    git tag -d 2.0
```

- Remove annotated tags in the same way
