# Combining Branches - What & Why?

## Combining Master & Feature Branches

- Say we create a feature branch
- It contains all the commits of the master branch up until the point of its creation
- Then, we make additional commits in the feature branch, **and** the master branch
- Now, we need to "pull-in" the latest version of the master branch to our feature branch

## The Two Types of Merges

### Fast-Forward Merge

- This applies when we have a feature branch that has new commits, but a master branch that has no additional commits after the creation of the feature branch
- The fast forward merge simply moves the head forward to the latest commit in the feature branch, but **does not create a new commit**
- So, the main branch's latest commit is now the last commit in the feature branch

#### Squash

```git
    git merge --squash <branch_to_be_merged>
```

- Merges a branch without bringing all its previous commits
- You only add one commit to your master branch this way
- All the commits are merged into one, and then placed in the staging area
- You then have to add and commit these changes for the commit to take effect and appear in the log!

### Non Fast-Forward Merge - Recursive

- note there are other types of non fast-forward merges, but we are only focusing on the recursive approach

#### --no-ff

- Using the no-ff option will merge using the recursive strategy, even if the main branch has no additional commits 
- The recursive merge (in this instance) will actually merge both branches and create a new commit, as opposed to simply moving the head to the latest commit in the feature branch

#### Merge when both branches have additional commits after the creation of the feature branch
